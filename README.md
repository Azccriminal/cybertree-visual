# Azcosf Project Structure

Azcosf is a cyber detection toolset developed by the founder. Thanks to the objective dump structure, users can dump any object with a camera and determine their identity or emotions accordingly. Additionally, with its night vision support, it is possible to analyze emotions or object structures both near and far. Azcosf can predict and determine the attack structure or object structure by directly analyzing the object, without solely relying on the camera.

## Main Purpose of Cyber Detection

The main purpose is to determine the attack and necessary scenarios by scanning other cyber attack object structures, providing the basis for the cyber tree structure. With cyber detection, you will no longer be in a situation where you cannot understand or identify any object or creature.

## How to Support the Cyber Detection Tree Structure?

You can support the project by sending donations or contributing to the object mind structure specified on our site.

## How can I train the dataset?
To train the dataset, you can use the face block coordinator Python code to save the necessary data in your face structure and determine the path to `csv-file.txt`. You can use this field as the direct CSV path: 

`instructorship-training/emotional/csv`

If you want to contribute on GitHub, you can train the photo URL with `url-file.txt`, or you can get the URL by saving the photo files directly to the following directory:

`instructorship-training/emotional/image`


It is possible to determine the scenario of event determination and event structure based on the real-time object structure or determine it separately from the object.
